### Description:

Hi *Talent*!
Ascii-art-web-Dockerise consists in creating and running a server which, based on the data entered by the user via a form, displays the result in a graphic representation using ASCII ,but adding docker to it.
This project's servor (back-end) is written using GO and the web documents (front-end) using HTML & CSS

#### Go,Html,Css & Docker:
***
- **GO**, also called Golang or Go language, is an open source programming language that Google developed.
* **HTML**,The HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
+ **CSS**,Cascading Style Sheets, form a computer language that describes the presentation of HTML documents.
- **Docker** can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile.
